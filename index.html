                Our goal as silly billys is to conquer the world with our silliness. When we have achieved 
                this goal, we will move on to an intergalactic scale. Firstly, we will conquer the Andromeda
                galaxy, and next we will take the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy. And continue doing so forever and EVER!!!

                 The Silly Billys, in their ambitious pursuit of global and intergalactic conquest through silliness, have hatched a whimsical plan for the ages. Their primary objective is to spread laughter and lightness across the world by injecting doses of pure, unadulterated silliness into every nook and cranny. Once they've successfully achieved this mission on Earth, the Silly Billys set their sights on the cosmic stage. Their intergalactic ambitions kick off with the Andromeda galaxy, where they plan to unleash a barrage of joyous antics that would make even the most stoic extraterrestrial beings giggle uncontrollably. The next cosmic conquest on their list is the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy, where they intend to establish a silliness empire that will echo through the vastness of space and time. With an unwavering commitment to perpetual silliness, the Silly Billys aim to continue their intergalactic escapades forever and ever, bringing laughter to the farthest reaches of the universe. Who knew conquering galaxies could be so delightfully absurd?
